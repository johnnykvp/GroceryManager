# GroceryManager

Writing a system to manage a mock-up grocery store.  The initial store inventory is read from a file.  Orders are read from file.  
The system stores the inventory, processes the orders, tracks which items are out of stock, and 
sorts the inventory list using two different algorithms.

#
The driver runs through the following scenario:
1.	Stock the store by reading inventory from a file
2.	Print inventory
3.	Process orders
4.	Print reorder list
5.	Sort by name, print inventory
6.	Sort by price, print inventory
